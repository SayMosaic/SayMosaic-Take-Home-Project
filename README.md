# SayMosaic-Take-Home-Project
This is a take home project for software engineering positions. Please finish within one week. You may send a zip file to `xuezheng.ma@saymosaic.com`. Or invite `xuezhma` to a private GitHub repo.

## Starting point
Use this following answer from a stackoverflow question (Draw on HTML5 Canvas using a mouse):
https://stackoverflow.com/a/8398189/5875244

We will build a whiteboard drawing app based on this answer. There are different tasks for frontend focus and backend focus. Basic requirement is required for everyone. You may choose to do either Frontend requirement or Backend requirement.

## Requirement

### Basic requirement

Use JavaScript, or a compile to JS lanuage. e.g. TypeScript.

Remove save and clear functionalities from the stackoverflow answer.

Refactor the stackoverflow answer to modern best practices. e.g. Change impure functions into pure functions.

#### Bounce points:
Setup ESLint

Include a Dockerfile

Deploy on heroku, or another service


### Frontend requirement

Create a website with 6 instances of the whiteboard. Each with a min size of 300px * 300px and max of 600px * 600px. They may fit in one row or several rows depending on how big the screen is. Implement a responsive design. (Remember to make sure drawing still works after a whiteboard is resized)

#### Bounce points:

Use client side storage to remember user's drawing when he close and reopens the website


### Backend requirement

Make this whiteboard a collaboration tool. All user on this website is drawing on the same whiteboard. Disable user from picking a color. Assign each of them a unique color.

#### Bounce points:

When user closes and reopens the website, you remember who he was and assign him his old color.
